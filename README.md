## Polynomial Approximation Numerical Integration (working title)

Material regarding a new numerical ODE solver I develop in the context of my thesis and its application to Neural ODEs.

Our goal is to create a parallel-in-time solver that leverages modern GPU architectures to address the bottlenecks of 
continuous time ML models. Renewed interest in these models was re-ignited by [[1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07366)].

For an implementation of Neural DEs in PyTorch see [[2](https://github.com/DiffEqML/torchdyn)]

### In this repo:
- Functional interface for the `pan_solver`
- Experiments for the solution of ODEs
- Latex code for (hopefully) future publication
- Matplotlib plots source 

### Lorenz attractor, system solved using PAN Integration.
